* Two identical, galvanically isolated voltage regulators 
* Strong connection terminals 
* Super-fast diodes with the corresponding performance 
* Several LOW-ESR filter capacitors connected in parallel 
* Stable and low-noise regulator with protective functions 
* Output voltage stabilized and adjustable: 1.3V to max 26V 
* High output capacities 
* Choke between the output electrolytic capacitors  
** Better properties when the outputs are connected in parallel
