# SPR5-HQ
An adjustable audiophile analog power supply that pushes the envelope  
Ready-to-install compact module up to 5A (without transformer)  
  
<strong>this module can <ins>not</ins> be used with center tapped transformers,
you <ins>have to</ins> use a transformer with two seperate secondary windings that are galvanically isolated from each other.</strong>

* Two identical, galvanically isolated positive voltage regulators 
* Strong connection terminals 
* Super-fast diodes with the corresponding performance 
* Several low-ESR filter capacitors connected in parallel 
* Stable and low-noise regulator IC with protective functions 
* Output voltage stabilized and adjustable: 1.3V to max 26V 
* High output capacities 
* special choke between the output electrolytic capacitors for the following advantages: 
  * Relief of the regulator IC with digital loads that load the voltage with high clock frequencies 
  * Unlimited large electrolytic capacitors can also follow
  * Better properties when the outputs are connected in parallel
