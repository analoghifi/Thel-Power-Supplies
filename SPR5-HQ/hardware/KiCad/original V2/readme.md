this is not the original Thel PCB but it's very like\* the original with the following exceptions:  
* more massive ground and power supply PCB tracks  
  
\*(same schematic / same board dimensions / same 1-layer\*\* layout THT / same THT components in the same places on the board)  
\*\*(strictly speaking, this KiCad PCB is a two-layer PCB with plated-through holes, but you can also (let) produce it as a classic 1-layer PCB with non-plated holes if you wish, since all the tracks are on the bottom side only)  
  
----  
  
these are KiCad 6.x projects
