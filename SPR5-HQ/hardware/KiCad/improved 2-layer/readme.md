#### differences to the original board:  
* 2-layer-design (2mm thick / 2oz copper / ENIG gold) / ultra low impedance design / very large PCB trace cross-sections
* transformer secondary snubber (CRC) per side (-> <a hef="https://github.com/analoghifi/Transformer-Snubber">see here</a>)
* additional HF-blocking/bypass ceramic caps very near to the regulator IC
* one additional big electrolytic output capacitor per side
