#### differences to the original board:  
* improved 2-layer-design
* ultra low impedance design 
* very large PCB trace cross-sections / copper areas
* 2mm thick / 2oz copper / ENIG gold finish
* transformer secondary snubber (CRC) per side (--> <a href="https://github.com/analoghifi/Transformer-Snubber">see here</a>)
* additional HF-blocking/bypass ceramic caps very near to the regulator IC
* double the output filter capacitors (after the choke) per side [now 2pc. of 2200ÂµF per side] (while maintaining the original board dimensions)
* more venting holes for the heatsinks (better cooling)
